## Introduction
The roadmap proposed here is meant for those that are getting started with web development and have a general interest towards it. Whether you're getting started or an experienced developer, this document can be useful to learning the topics that you need to know to be successful in web development. No previous knowledge is required. However, an open mind is appreciated as there will a lot of topics covered within this roadmap.
<!-- ============================================================================= -->
## How To Read This Document
I suggest reading this document in sequence starting from the beginning at [Understanding the Internet](#understanding-the-internet) and ending on [insert topic here](#insert-topic-here). Each topic may require background knowledge of the previous topics. If this is the case, it will be highlighted in the Prerequisite heading.

The topics covered within the roadmap will be in the following format:
1. **Prerequisite**
2. **What** is it?
3. **Why** it's important
4. **How much** I need to know
5. **Resources**
6. **Time frame**

Feel to start wherever you'd like. :)

## Understanding the Internet
### 1. Prerequisite
N/A
### 2. What is it?
In simple terms, it is a network of computers connected together from all over the world.
### 3. Why it's important
As these computers are connected, this means that we are able to send information from one computer to another. This is important in web development because we, as web developers, develop websites and in order for someone else on another computer to see the website you built, the website has to be sent to their computer.
### 4. How much I need to know?
I've simplified the above explanation of the internet so that you can understand the main idea of the idea (which is the sending of information). IMO, the explanation in [3. Why it's important](#3-why-its-important) is enough for web development. It's not required that you know exactly how the internet infrastructure is set up or how it first got started. However, I do believe that you should come back to this and understand the internet have a better grasp of how the internet works through the [resources](#5-resources) listed.

## HTML
### 1. Prerequisite
N/A
### 2. What is it?
Think of HTML as the blueprints to a website. Whatever elements (buttons, text, lines, etc.) we want to add to a website, we use HTML to add it. It is used to described the structure of a website. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. Hyper Text is just text with links to other websites or web pages and Markup Language is just the electronic document in a standard text-encoding system that is used to structure the website or web page.
### 3. Why it's important
As stated in [2. What is it?](2-what-is-it-1), HTML is used to describe the structure of a website. It is the standard Markup Language that is used for writing websites. Hence, it is what you will be using as well.
### 4. How much I need to know?
As this is the standard for writing websites or web pages, it is important to learn the basics and even the best practices of HTML.

***First, let's start off with the basics***. You can learn all of these from [W3Schools HTML Tutorial][html-resource-2]. You will need to learn about:
- HTML syntax
- tags
  - script (when we start using JavaScript)
- attributes
  - class (when we start using CSS)
  - id
- styles
- color
- comments
- elements
  - head
  - body
  - headings
  - paragraphs
  - styles
  - links
  - forms
    - labels
    - input types
  - tables
  - lists

***When it comes to best practices***, there is a lot to consider, but I will only suggest the following two:
- semantic HTML / HTML semantics
- accessibility

You can learn these from [W3Schools HTML Tutorial][html-resource-2]. If you want to learn more about HTML best practices, you can check out the following link: [https://github.com/hail2u/html-best-practices][html-resource-3]
### 5. Resources
**What HTML is?**
- What is HyperText ([https://www.w3.org/WhatIs.html][html-resource-0])
- Markup Language ([https://www.britannica.com/technology/markup-language][html-resource-1])

**Learning HTML**
- W3Schools HTML Tutorial ([https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp][html-resource-2])
- Best Practices ([https://github.com/hail2u/html-best-practices][html-resource-3])
### 6. Time frame
~ 1 week

## CSS
### 1. Prerequisite
N/A
### 2. What is it?
CSS is a language that is specifies how elements in an HTML document will look to the user.
### 3. Why it's important
The default presentation (styles) that elements have are plain and dull so CSS is used to style the elements on an HTML document the way you want. Styling is one the important aspects that define a user's experience on a website. Thus, CSS is critical to any website or web page.
### 4. How much I need to know?
Here, you can get away with learning the basics of CSS. However, I recommend learning the advanced techniques as well.

The basics can be learned on [W3Schools][css-resource-0]. They include the following:
- CSS syntax
- selectors
- comments
- colors
- padding
- margin
- borders
- height/width
- display

However, for the advanced techniques, and an overall better understanding of CSS, I suggest to learn from the following link [https://web.dev/learn/css/][css-resource-1]. Going through all the modules in the link will widen your perspective on the styles CSS is capable of and build a strong foundation when working on designing a website or web page.
